# Disease Prediction System (DPS)

## Problem Statement
Many people get confused when they have common symptoms like cough, fever, or headache. This small Python project helps the user understand which common illness their symptoms might match.  
It is only for learning and practice, not for real medical advice.

## Scope of the Project
This project includes:
- A simple disease and symptom list  
- A basic matching system  
- *Three modules* that work together:  
  - *mod1.py* – stores diseases and symptoms  
  - *mod2.py* – checks matching symptoms  
  - *main.py* – takes user input and shows results  

This project does *not* include:
- No machine learning  
- No online system or database  
- No personal data  
- No professional medical accuracy  

## Target Users
This project is mainly for:
- Students learning Python  
- Beginners who want a small and clear project  
- Anyone who wants to understand how symptom-matching works in a simple way  

## High-Level Features
- Shows a list of symptoms with numbers  
- User selects symptoms by entering the numbers  
- Program finds diseases that match those symptoms  
- Gives clear, easy-to-read results  
- Handles wrong input without crashing  
- Code is simple, modular, and easy to understand
